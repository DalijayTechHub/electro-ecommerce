2. **Protected Routes:** React Router guards with Cognito
3. **GraphQL Integration:** Apollo Client with AWS AppSync
4. **State Management:** useState + useReducer for cart logic

## 📈 **Performance Optimizations**
- React.lazy() for code splitting
- useMemo() for expensive calculations
- CloudFront CDN for static assets
- DynamoDB on-demand scaling

## 🔐 **Security Features**
- Cognito JWT tokens in React context
- Protected API routes with user authentication
- S3 bucket policies for secure asset access
- Environment variables for sensitive configs

## 🎯 **React + AWS Benefits**
- Amplify CLI for seamless React deployment
- Auto-generated GraphQL hooks
- Built-in authentication components
- Serverless scaling without infrastructure management

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements**
- React Native mobile app
- Stripe payment integration
- Real-time chat with AppSync subscriptions
